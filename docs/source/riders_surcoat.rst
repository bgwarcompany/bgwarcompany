Rider's Surcoat
===============

The rider's surcoat is popular with chivalric fighters and is designed so that it can be comfortably worn over armor. 
This design is a basic sleeveless surcoat, with a rider's slit up the front and back.

*NOTE*: This is NOT A BEGINNING sewing project.  
Sewing one of these requires advanced sewing skills, including comfort with machine applique on sharp points and tight curves. 
The barony runs periodic sewing days where we assembly-line these coats so that everybody can get one, regardless of skill.

Build left side panel

Build six halberd stripes

1. Iron black linen to your fusible and cut 6 stripes that are 4 inches wide and long enough to cover the diagonal of your surcoat pattern.  I know that they will be visually diagonal, but I recommend cutting the stripes on the grain so that they don't wiggle while you sew.  
2. Iron gold linen to your fusible and cut six halberds with shafts long enough to reach the end of your stripes.
3. Iron down the halberds to the stripes with a 1-inch margin from the center line. 
4. Machine applique satin stitch the halberds to the stripes using the lighter Golden Rod colored thread.  This color provides a lighter outline for the gold fabric.
