Rider's Surcoat
===============

The rider's surcoat is popular with chivalric fighters and is designed so that it can be comfortably worn over armor. 
This design is a basic sleeveless surcoat, with a rider's slit up the front and back.

*NOTE*: This is NOT A BEGINNING sewing project.  
Sewing one of these requires advanced sewing skills, including comfort with machine applique on sharp points and tight curves. 
The barony runs periodic sewing days where we assembly-line these coats so that everybody can get one, regardless of skill.
